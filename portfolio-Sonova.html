        At Sonova, I was a Software Quality Assurance Analyst. My job was to execute and maintain various tests using the software that configures hearing instruments. There is such a vast network of information related to specific hearing instruments, their softwares, their accessories and their configuration that had to be referenced and used everyday. It was a steep learning curve, but slowly I gained confidence and competency in the world of personal hearing instruments. Working in the Agile methodology alongside the software development team, I would report potential bugs and find as much information as possible about their occurrence. The job required patience and accuracy to ensure bugs are found by our team, not by the customer.

        Working at a larger company was a fantastic learning experience due to the amount of teams that had to work in harmony. I set up my learning goals to get more of an insight into my coworkers, how they worked and what technology they worked with. 
        <br><br>
        My first learning goal was to learn more about the Agile development cycle. As a computer science student, I hadn’t been exposed to this working format in school, so I thought this job would be a great place to start. I did some reading on Agile and paid attention in our sprint planning and stand up meetings. By following progress on specific tasks and features (especially the ones implemented because of my bug reports) I gained a deeper understanding of how Agile works in practice.
        <br><br>
        My second learning goal was to learn more about the automation done at the company. Unfortunately, this learning goal had to be set aside due to how busy our team was. Instead, I inquired into the codebase that ran our software. I went into the Kitchener office and spent a day shadowing a fitting domain developer on our team, Mario. I got a firsthand tour of the languages and organization of the millions of lines that make up the fitting software. Mario and I first fixed a bug, then pair-programmed a new feature. It was a great experience not only to program and learn the behind-the-scenes of the software, but also to track how the new feature was picked up by the team, tested and eventually put into a final build.
        <br><br>
        My third learning goal was simply to get to know my co-workers better. In a remote position, it is easy to forget that there are people working alongside you in similar positions. In my case, there were a lot of other Guelph Co-op students in their final years of school who were happy to give me advice and recommendations for the rest of my terms. Luckily, our team manager Kevin valued the importance of our team really knowing each other, scheduling two team lunches which I attended. It was great to finally see my coworkers in person, and try to learn from their careers and enjoy their company.

        Sonova taught me so much about what it means to be an effective employee, coworker, student and teacher. Having strong meaning associated with your work is something I certainly undervalued until this job. It seems to bind everyone together, instilling patience, focus and respect for our work along the way.

        I would like to thank Chris and Mishel for hiring me, training me, answering my questions and being some of the kindest and most patient people I have ever met in my life. I’d also like to thank my coworkers Roba, Teran, Emily and Jacob for giving me advice, being encouraging and even giving me rides to the office. I hope we cross paths again someday!    </p>
